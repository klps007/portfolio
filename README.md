1. Purpose and Target Audience

My website was created with the purpose of providing the target audience or potential employer's with a simple means of finding & contacting me and viewing my projects across different platform.

2. Functionality

Functionality has been achieved by creating a signle page site with simple top page navigation linked to the content below, the uncluttered design provides consistency and allows the page to be easily read and accessible to users with a disability. The page is quick to load and includes an email contact form and social media buttons

3. Tech Stack

My site was written using HTML and CSS, deployed via Netlify and is partly responsive, content, functionality and complexity of the site will improve and develop as my skills do. 

4. Technical Challenges

The entire project was a technically challenge with this being my first website, as the project progressed my ability to move objects around and knowing which part of the code changes a particular aspect of that element. As the project progressed my skill and knowledged improved it became quicker and easier because I wasn't having to stop and solve problems after each line of code.

9. Design

I had no idea what i wanted my site to look like or how i would achieve that but i wanted to have some kind of personal connection with the images and theme of the site and finally settled on an image of Jacksonville Beach Florida. 

10. Moodboard

Other design considerations included a pink/neon type theme inspired by a picture on pinrest and another to use my kids art work as the main image and to determine the color theme.

14. History Of The Internet from 1980 - 

The NSF, providers of the cornerstone foundations of todays global internet, approved a grant to Universities to establish CNET, 6 supercomputing centers in universities across the US with about 100 users on the network, in 1982 when TCP & IP took over from ARPNET the modern internet was born. In 1983 the Domain Name Systems (DNS) .com, .edu etc was introduced and by 1989 there was 25 countries now connected and the the World Wide Web went public. 

The 1990's brought the launch of ebay and the creation of yahoo, google and internet dating. The tech bubble burst in early 2000 and the social media revolution began with facebook having 400 million users by 2004 and an estimated 92 million website where online by 2006 Despite whistle blower edward snowden revealing spy plots against US citizens 51% of people still choose to bank online with over 3 billion users on the internet today.

15. Relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet - 

 Web browsers or web servers eg google chrome are web service tools used to find other webpages, websites are a collection of webpages, the browser receives the html documents and renders it as a multimedia documents.  

All machines have a unique series of numbers, colones and dots or an IP (Internet Protocol) address and a corresponding Domain Name stored on the DNS (Domain Name Systems) database, the DNS acts as the phonebook of the internet and gives every machine the ability to know how and where to contact other machines. Domain names are imperative to visitors and search engines locating sites.

16. Internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today - 

Email was created in 1972 as an experiment by the military to send  receive messages from the front line, the TFP program was written in two separate parts SNDMSG to send and READMAIL to receive and provided standard network transport capabilities for email. SMPT took over from TFP in the 1980's and has since involved many programs and people working to improve it. 

Email predates the internet and was a critical tool in its development. Today Email is available free of charge through user friendly web interfaces like hotmail, the medium has been adopted by hundreds of millions people and considered the quintessential method for communication despite flaws in the protocol often exploited by virus, security fraud and spammers.
